Description

Are you growing tired of the standard snowboard games out there? Kick it up a notch with Xtrem Snowboarding for your Android device. Execute tricks and earn high scores in this fun and simple game.
Jump in and slide down the slopes with ease. As soon as you jump off of a ramp, you must follow the colored dots with your finger to perform a trick. The more tricks you do for each ramp, the more points you'll earn. The game is over when you don't perform the required amount of tricks for the level.
The faster you execute a trick, the more points you will earn per trick. If you hit the floor while you're in the middle of a trick (red dot), you crash and loose all the points for the current ramp. If it's an orange dot, you don't lose any points. When you land on a green dot, you'll pull off a perfect landing and earn double points.
